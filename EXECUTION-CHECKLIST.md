## 🆘 IF THINGS GO WRONG

### Behind Schedule?
**Priority order**:
1. Get automation working (MUST have)
2. Send LinkedIn messages (MUST have)
3. Create landing page (SHOULD have)
4. Make demo materials (NICE to have)

### Technical Issues?
**Backup plans**:
- Make.com down → Use Zapier
- OpenAI expensive → Use GPT-3.5-turbo
- Carrd issues → Use Google Sites
- Can't code → Focus on manual process first

### Low Motivation?
**Remember**:
- Every successful founder started here
- €49/month customer = €588/year
- 10 customers = €5,880/year passive income
- This weekend can change your life

- ✅ After first customer: Celebration dinner
- ✅ After €500 MRR: Weekend trip
