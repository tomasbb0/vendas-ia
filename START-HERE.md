## 🎯 Decision Points

### End of Weekend
✅ If automation works → Continue  
❌ If technical issues → Use manual process temporarily

### End of Week 1
✅ If 1+ customer → Scale messaging  
⚠️ If 0 customers but 5+ demos → Improve pitch  
❌ If <5 demos → Improve messaging

### End of Month 1
✅ If €200+ MRR → Build real product  
⚠️ If €50-200 MRR → Optimize conversion  
❌ If <€50 MRR → Pivot messaging or market

---

## 💪 Motivation

### Why This Will Work
✅ Real pain (teams waste 20+ hours/week)  
✅ Clear ROI (€49 cost, €300+ value)  
✅ Underserved market (Portuguese B2B)  
✅ Proven demand (competitors exist abroad)  
✅ Your advantage (Portuguese + technical skills)

### What Could Go Wrong
⚠️ Technical issues → Use simpler tools  
⚠️ No responses → Improve messaging  
⚠️ No conversions → Lower price/improve demo  
⚠️ Lose motivation → Remember: €10K MRR = life changing

### Remember
> "Every successful SaaS started with 0 customers.  
> The only difference is they got customer #1.  
> You're 48 hours away from being them."
